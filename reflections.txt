I'm supposed to reflect on how seeing the didference between two files would help debugging.

It makes it easier to see changes and see eerors introduced. It might change the way one would approach programming.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

I was thinking that version control might change the way
you program. But today I am at a loss.
for how that could be true.

Go back and see how you used to approach
problems

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git,
 vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

 Automatic: I can forget and not worry!
 Manual: finer control over commit
 Logical differentiation between commits.
 Document the commit/ better understanding of each change

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Easier to treat files differently. Multiple files make the system more complex
Multiple files in certain situations can be very useful

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log gives a broad vision of changes.
Git diff_ gives a view of difference between individual commits. 
Requires good use of commit information

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Little fear that you could it fix something
Commit before making changes?
