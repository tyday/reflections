I'm not doing great following instructions. I accidentally stepped ahead of the teacher. Although, it makes me feel smarter. But I'm not. I've been working on git shit all day through a different medium.

I need to make a list of git commands if I plan on continuing to use git
from the command line.

I think the staging area allows for finer control.

I don't know that I see a need for it... at least in my programming skill
so far. But maybe in the future

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

So. The weird thing seems to be that the staging area alllows me to make many changes
then come back and group the changes so that they are in a logical form
then commit them in groups.

It makes sense... from the point of view of people who are working with many files on 
many things. Otherwise you could only really do one thing at a time.
