When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
--To make your work available on multiple computers
--to share your work with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather 
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
--To prevent changes to the branch from bieng applied to the code you're working on

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?
-- Forks... a clone on github
-- Clone.... a full copy of a git repository. 
-- Branch... a change from the master of a git clone. A side project.

-- Looks like they can be used together. Fork someone else's project. Clone it 
-- onto your computer. And call your work a branch... which I assume requires a
-- rename or operation of some sort. Then ask to push your idea back onto the
-- main branch of the original?
-- That sounds like i described branching.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
-- review changes. revert to working copies. comparison to online versions

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
-- shared online file.
-- more difficult. No management. Would require greater communication between people
-- easier. No githubese to learn.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
-- seems like anytime you're working on major changes to a project
-- anytime you're working with multiple people
